# 🏦 Banking Management System

Hi there! I'm Akash Mondal, and this is my **Java-based Banking Management System** — a terminal application that simulates the key functionalities of real-world banking. From user authentication to account transactions, this project is built with **Java, JDBC**, and **MySQL**, giving me practical experience in backend development and database integration.

This project allowed me to apply my core programming skills in a real-world context and understand how secure and efficient banking operations work behind the scenes.

## ✨ Key Features

Here's what I built into the system:

| 🚀 Feature | 📝 Description |
|-----------|----------------|
| 👤 **User Registration & Login** | Users can register with a unique email and 4-digit PIN, and log in securely. |
| 🏦 **Account Management** | Supports account creation with an initial balance and allows managing account details. |
| 💸 **Debit & Credit Transactions** | Users can deposit or withdraw money with real-time balance updates. |
| 🔁 **Fund Transfers** | Enables transferring funds between accounts securely after PIN verification. |
| 💰 **Balance Inquiry** | Instantly displays current account balance. |
| 🔒 **PIN-Based Security** | All sensitive operations require PIN input to enhance security. |

> 🔐 **Security Matters:** Account numbers and emails are validated for uniqueness. All sensitive operations are PIN protected to mimic real-world security practices.
